Revision history for Perl extension TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::pgTAP.

3.22  2010-08-15T01:06:08
      - Moved from the Test::Harness distribution to its own distribution.
      - No assume that a test string starting with "pgtap:" and is not a file
        name is SQL to be executed.
      - Moved `pg_prove` from the pgTAP distribution and rewrote it to use
        App::Prove and pgTAP.
      - Rewrote `pg_prove` to use App::Prove, thus gaining most of its
        features.
